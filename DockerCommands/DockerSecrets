Secrets Storage

Easiest secure way to store the Secrets like usename, password, TLS certficate,SSH keys, and any data that we prefer not to shown to others

Supports string and binary contents upto 500KB in size

Keys are stored only on the manager nodes

Secrets are stored on the swarm, then assigned to a service

They look like a container but actually stored on the memory fs
/run/secrets/<secrets-name>
/run/secrets/<secrets-alias>

Creating secrets file in 2 different ways
1. by using the file upload
docker secret create <name_psql_user> psql_user.txt

2. by entering the details on the CLI
echo "myPassword" | docker secret create <password_pql_pass> -

Assigning the secret to the new service which we create
docker service create --name psql --secret name_psql_user --secret password_pql_pass /
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secret/<password_pql_pass>  /
-e POSTGRES_USER_FILE=/run/secret/<name_psql_user> 


Secret on swarm
=================
Just like previous example, we will create 2 txt files for user-name and password
Along with that we will alos have the docker-compose.yml file in which we have below

version: "3.1"   #secrets only on on v3.1 and above

services:
  psql:
    image: postgres
    secrets:
      - psql_user
      - psql_password
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/psql_password
      POSTGRES_USER_FILE: /run/secrets/psql_user

secrets:
  psql_user:
    file: ./psql_user.txt
  psql_password:
    file: ./psql_password.txt

docker stack deploy -c docker-compose. yml <stackname>
