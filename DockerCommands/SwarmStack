Stacks: Production grade compose 

Stacks accepts compose files as their declarative definition for services, network and volumes

docker stack deploy   //command used to run the compose file rather than just using the docker service create.
                      //similar to using the docker-compose up to run the dockercompose files rather than running the docker container run commands

Note: Stack is only for ONE Swarm and not for many swarms

Write all the stacks on a compose file, as we wrote earlier 

name the file anything like <docker-app-stack.yml> file
